# TODOs
- [x] Clean dates
- [x] Join missing_report
- [x] Make profiles
- [x] Make pairplot
- [x] Join shift_report
- [ ] Group location data and make use of ZIP code
- [ ] Generate synthetic data for missing values
  - Make it group specific (for positive/negative samples)

# Sporadic Thoughts and Issues
- Dataset highly imbalanced
  - Dropping nan-values removes half of the positive samples > more imbalance
- It is evident from the pairplot that short, heavy people are abducted to a greater extent 
(could a sadistic doctor be our culprit?!)
